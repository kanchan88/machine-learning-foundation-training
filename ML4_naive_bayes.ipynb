    "In machine learning, Naïve Bayes classification is a straightforward and powerful algorithm for the classification task. Naïve Bayes classification is based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong independence assumption between the features.  Naïve Bayes classification produces good results when we use it for textual data analysis such as Natural Language Processing.\n",

For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute x. We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of x in each class. Let µi be the mean of the values and let σi be the variance of the values associated with the ith class. Suppose we have some observation value xi .

    "\n",
    "### Precision\n",

    "### Recall\n",
    "Recall can be defined as the percentage of correctly predicted positive outcomes out of all the actual positive outcomes. It can be given as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (TP + FN). Recall is also called Sensitivity.\n",

    "### f1-score\n",
    "f1-score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The best possible f1-score would be 1.0 and the worst would be 0.0. f1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. So, f1-score is always lower than accuracy measures as they embed precision and recall into their computation. The weighted average of f1-score should be used to compare classifier models, not global accuracy."

This will give us the general performance of the ROC curve which consists of the TPR and FPR at various threshold levels. So, an ROC Curve plots TPR vs FPR at different classification threshold levels. If we lower the threshold levels, it may result in more items being classified as positve. It will increase both True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP)."
